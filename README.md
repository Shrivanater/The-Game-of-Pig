# The-Game-of-Pig

A rendition of the dice game Pig. Itâ€™s a 2-player game where a dice is rolled by a player and the number rolled is added to their temporary points. The player may continue to roll either until they choose to hold and add their points to their permanent score or until they roll a 1 which removes their temporary points. First to 50 points wins. Made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
